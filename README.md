## Introduction
**TV+** is a SPA developed to search for information about movies, tv shows, videogames or music videos. It's responsive design allows you to use it on large screens, tablets and mobile devices.

The latest version was deployed using *Heroku*'s server. Feel free use it and let me know what you think! [Link](https://tv-plus.herokuapp.com/)!

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- Express
- Heroku

Obs. Even though the html file was saved as an .ejs file, the file extension was not actually used other than for the need to set a template engine for NodeJS and Express. For this reason, it was replaced by HTML on the Tech Stack.
